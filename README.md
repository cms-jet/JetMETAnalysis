JetMETAnalysis
==============

The code contained in this package is used for creating and analyzing the L2Relative and L3Absolute jet energy corrections (JEC), based on high level trigger of CMS. The code is used by the JetMet trigger development subgroup.

The JetAnalyzers subpackage relies upon the JetUtilities subpackage.

The JetUtilities subpackage contains useful tools and plugins for the JetMETAnalysis-JetAnalyzers package, but they can also be used outside of the JetAnalyzers framework (i.e. CommandLine tools).
